# PhantomMenaceCS2110
Android game Project from CS 2110

This game was completed as a final project for CS2110: Software Development Methods,
in the Fall of 2014 at the University of Virginia. The objective of the game is
survival. Each time the player moves, every ghost on screen moves in a random direction.
If a ghost enters the same square as the player's sword (which is 1 square ahead of the 
player in whatever direction they are facing), the ghost is killed. If a ghost lands in 
the same square as the player, the player dies. Every time a ghost dies, two more are 
spawned at random points to take its place. The game continues until the player dies, and
the player's score is recorded.

In order to play this game, one needs the Eclipse IDE with the Android SDK installed. Alternatively,
one can "publish" the game to an Android executable and run it on any compatible Android Device. The
game was made with Android SDK version 21.
